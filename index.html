        <h1><b>Happy Valentines Day BaeBeee!!❤️</b></h1>
        
        <!-- New Summary Paragraph -->
        <p class="summary">
            Okay I don't know how to start this or where to start this, I am so in loveee with youuu, from the day we saw ganpati together (I still remember that spark in your eyes) to that sunset where i almost confessed but could't, and then every every little thing, we did together, from doing club's work to helping random kids on escalators, to taking interviews. All of this has grew my love and affection towards you babyyy, and i really really wanna buy you flowers for rest of my life. As you like to say "We are the endgame, it's just you" same goes for me too. It has been a tough time for us, but you remember the phases right, we won't give upp on each other so easily. You give me motivation to be better and boost my confidence so much, even if the situation is set against us, we thrive in those situations. I am glad, that we are together. We have done the difficult part of finding each other in millions of people, now it's the easy part of not letting go ever. <b>HAPPIEST VALENTINES DAY BABYYYY</b>, this is our first valentines and i am really very excited for it as every year it's different for me, there is no one to celeberate with, but this one, I would love to celeberate it with youu. <b>LOVE YOUU BEE, AND ONCE AGAIN HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!! <3</b>

            <p>I still remember me waiting at macd and you got late, but it was all worth it. You going to macd of ccm instead of college road, funny yet cute, i fell for you more that day. Also when we were sitting besides each other at La Barista and you pulled me in to say something random, just to be close to you, omg that feeling, I could smell your hair, so fresh and I really just wanted to get more close to you (Maybe kiss you hehe).</p></div>

I am not that interested in books, but I just wanted to hangout with you ehehe, the place didn't matter, also it was fun choosing random books and saying " have you read it? " knowing damn well i was reading the title of that book for the first time. Also did I ever mention that top looks so good on you,I like it so much BABYYY.</p>

I manned up and said you looked so cutee in kala katha, but I couldn't say much idk, not that open, but i will never forget that day, that cafe, those vibe of singing shape of you while driving and dedicating every word to you, we should go back there soon!!</p>

Doing GARBA with you was peak moment for me, like uk in Marwadis, garba is so much important to the culture and I have been attending it's events since childhood, hence it held so much importance to me. I really want us to go to garba every year, same enthusiasm, same weird steps, not knowing how to do garba but yes!</p>

            <h2>Young Love</h2>
            <p>There’s a sparkle in your eye,<br>
            I swear it wasn’t there before.<br>
            Like you’re holding a secret,<br>
            That only I get to explore.</p>
        
            <p>From changing rooms to your PLACE,<br>
            Your lips have been my favorite view.<br>
            Turns out, no matter the place,<br>
            I’d choose makeouts with you.</p>
        
            <p>You are not my FIRST love,<br>
            but you are my first LOVE.<br>
            The love I achieved in month of September,<br>
            there is a part of me who wants to hold you forever.</p>
        
            <p>However I know forever sounds ambitious,<br>
            With you being capricious.<br>
            But I promise, I'd always be gentle,<br>
            Till the time our love gets as tough as a metal.</p>
        
            <p>Even if the world fades grey,<br>
            you'll be my favorite color.<br>
            So here's my poem-not perfect but true,<br>
            Because every word here, it's all about you.</p>
